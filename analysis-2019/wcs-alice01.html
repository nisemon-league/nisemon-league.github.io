		<h2>Concept Phase</h2>
		<p>
			Building this team came from the silly idea of "What if we had a mega in a meta in which megas were banned?" From there I went with the idea that Necrozma Dusk Mane is basically a better Mega Metagross and decided to continue feeding my terrible addiction of giving mons that already have a stupidly high attack stat Choice Band and… well, gave it a choice band. Much like my first Regigigas team in Nisemon Singles, I wanted a form of speed control so my first thought was to go with either Talonflame or Whimsicott for Tailwind, but ended up eventually making the better judgement call of using Trick Room as my form of control for this team. Since teams that dedicate 110% to Trick Room are super fragile in my opinion, I decided to only make the team semi-room to hopefully give it more depth.

		<h2>Team Building</h2>

		<p>
			Necrozma-Dusk-Mane @ Choice Band<br/>
			Ability: Prism Armor<br/>
			EVs: 244 HP / 252 Atk / 12 SpD<br/>
			Brave Nature<br/>
			IVs: 0 Spe<br/>
			- Sunsteel Strike<br/>  
			- Earthquake<br/>
			- Photon Geyser<br/>
			- Knock Off<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Starting the team off with what the main concept started with, this set overall had little to no input from me aside from the Choice Band. Pokeytrix gave me the moves and the general idea of how to use it, and I just ran with it. 244 HP to keep its health odd at level 50 and make the most of Prism Armor, 252 Attack to make the most of Choice Band, and 12 Special Defence because why not. (Actually because Kyogre and Xerneas are scary)<br/>
			<br/>
			Aside from the stat spread, Sunsteel Strike and Photon Geyser are the standard “hit as hard as physically possible” STAB moves, Earthquake is nice Ground coverage to handle the likes of Tapu Koko and extremely occasionally Incineroar as well as anything quad-weak to the type, and lastly Knock Off is not only just nice to have in a meta where all items are knock-off...able(?) but also to handle things like Lunala, Necrozma (both forms), and Cresselia.
		</p>

		<p>
			Cresselia @ Iapapa Berry<br/>
			Ability: Levitate<br/>
			EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD<br/>  
			Modest Nature<br/>
			IVs: 0 Atk<br/>
			- Trick Room<br/>
			- Psychic<br/>
			- Ice Beam<br/>
			- Helping Hand<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Next as Necrozma’s partner in crime, Cresselia! I actually considered putting Mimikyu here instead since almost always guaranteed Trick Room (with the exception of Sunsteel Strike, Moongeist Beam, and Kyurem) and ghost type coverage sounded nice on paper, but after careful consideration I realised Mimikyu doesn’t do any of the support I needed Cresselia for.<br/>
			<br/>
			I also quite like Cresselia just because of its incredible bulk. An option I should have considered for the mon was running more Special Defense to live a Moongeist Beam from Choice Specs Lunala, but overall I don’t think this spread was a bad call. 252 HP and Special Attack only to fully capitalise on Cresselia’s bulk and fully counter Zygarde that I for some reason thought would be a huge threat in a meta with Mewtwo and Kyogre. Still, the grand total of one Zygarde I saw on Battle Spot couldn’t touch it so I suppose it did it’s job at last once.<br/>
			<br/>
			Additionally, for Cresselia, if it wasn’t obvious, I wanted to go for my crack idea of offensive support. Aside from the obvious Trick Room to give Necrozma the ultimate upper hand, Psychic was added to hit things harder than I’d expect ever from a Cresselia and Ice Beam was added with the soul intention of taking care of Zygarde but ended up also being nice for Groudon which it can easily pick up a nice 2HKO on.<br/>
			<br/>
			I opted for Ice Beam instead of Icy Wind not only because of the damage but because I figured I didn’t want to make a mistake and turn Trick Room against myself. Lastly, I could have run Protect, but I decided to opt for Helping Hand instead because it has a lot more applications and honestly, Cresselia was the last Pokemon I was expecting to stick around all game. To put into perspective how helpful this move is over Protect is, Rayquaza has almost a 50% chance to OHKO Assault Vest Incineroar with Focus Blast with Cresselia’s help.

		<p>
			Incineroar @ Assault Vest<br/>
			Ability: Intimidate<br/>
			EVs: 252 HP / 196 Atk / 60 SpD<br/>  
			Adamant Nature<br/>
			- Fake Out<br/>
			- Knock Off<br/>
			- Flare Blitz<br/>
			- U-turn<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Speaking of Assault Vest Incineroar, might as well abuse the broken things in a meta. If you’d have told me two years ago that there would not only be a Pokemon better than Landorus but that Incineroar was that Pokemon, I’d have laughed at you… but now here we are. To put into perspective how absolutely insane Incineroar is, it survives Choice Specs Tapu Koko’s Thunder in Electric Terrain and Kyogre’s Water Spout outside of Rain. 252 HP because we’re already slow as dirt, 60 Special Defense to make use of Assault Vest, and 196 Attack because why pick between being bulky and offensive when you can be both?<br/>
			<br/>
			Overall that this mon is here for is just nice Intimidate momentum and also to counter Lunala and Necrozma Dawn Wings outside of Trick Room while also being an abuser of Trick Room whenever the occasion arises. Incineroar is also a nice counter to Kartana, surviving a Sacred Sword and being able to OHKO in return (in the absence of a Focus Sash), and Tapu Bulu, surviving every move it can throw at Incineroar and being able to OHKO in return once again.<br/>
			<br/>
			In order to make the above possible, it has Fake Out to break sashes or just the usual helpful flinch, Knock Off for its primary purpose of countering the pesky Psychic/Ghosts, Flare Blitz to hit everything else hard, and U-turn to really take momentum and run with it every time a chance reveals itself. Overall, there’s little you can go wrong with this guy.

		<p>
			Rayquaza @ Focus Sash<br/>
			Ability: Air Lock<br/>
			EVs: 124 HP / 252 SpA / 132 SpD<br/>  
			Modest Nature<br/>
			IVs: 0 Atk<br/>
			- Focus Blast<br/>
			- Ice Beam<br/>
			- Thunderbolt<br/>
			- Protect<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			What began to worry me here in team building was Kyogre and to a lesser extent Groudon. So, what’s a better way to get rid of weather than the 2016 tried and true method of slapping a Rayquaza on everything? Overall, I opted to go for special Rayquaza just because I really didn’t like the idea of both my restricted Pokemon being physical attackers and Rayquaza gets access to bolt-beam because why not.<br/>
			<br/>
			The spread for this set is a little bit interesting, in my opinion, and something I’m a little bit proud of. I ran no speed but still max IVs to make use of Trick Room when it was up but also to remain naturally faster than some threats, most notably Incineroar. 124 HP and 132 Special Defense was for Kyogre specifically; Water Spout only 2HKOs considering I don’t do any damage to Kyogre between attacks, with a maximum of 60% damage, and Origin Pulse only does a measly 44.3% at most.<br/>
			<br/>
			Initially I was running Draco Meteor on Rayquaza because my brain auto-assumed “Dragons must have dragon STAB” but the more and more than move screwed me over the more and more I thought about replacing it, and so I did with Focus Blast just to take care of pesky Incineroars. Bolt-beam there for the usual reasons, and Protect instead of something else just because Rayquaza is a fragile boy who needs to be sheltered, even with defensive investments.
		</p>
		<img src="https://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/tapu_bulu.gif"/>
		<p>
			Tapu Bulu @ Choice Scarf<br/>
			Ability: Grassy Surge<br/>
			EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe<br/>  
			Jolly Nature<br/>
			- Wood Hammer<br/>
			- Horn Leech<br/>
			- Superpower<br/>
			- Rock Slide<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point in team building, I really did not like that my team was as slow as it was. Sure, Rayquaza could naturally outspeed some threats, but what about things like Scarf Kyogre that still ended this team’s life? Enter my favourite set from 2018, Scarf Bulu. Overall just being here as a reliable nuke either when my options are beginning to look a little thin or an easy lead when Scarf Kyogre is an obvious lead, Tapu Bulu nicely begins to round out this team and adds to the partially existent F/W/G and F/D/S cores I had slightly going on.<br/>
			<br/>
			The spread is nothing special and neither are the moves, since overall this guy’s a little straightforward. Max attack and speed because we’re a fast nuke, Wood Hammer and Horn Leech partially because other options are few and far between but also because Wood Hammer does a lot of damage to a lot of different Pokemon and Horn Leech is nice for recovery and an insurance policy. Superpower since Incineroar and Ferrothorn exist and Rock Slide because if there’s a Rock Slide, there’s a way.
		</p>
		<img src="https://www.smogon.com/dex/media/sprites/xy/gastrodon.gif"/>
		<p>
			Gastrodon @ Mago Berry<br/>
			Ability: Storm Drain<br/>
			EVs: 124 HP / 148 Def / 208 SpA / 20 SpD<br/>  
			Modest Nature<br/>
			IVs: 0 Atk<br/>
			- Earth Power<br/>
			- Scald<br/>
			- Recover<br/>
			- Protect<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, my happy little accident. As a nice defensive way to round out this team, I wanted to add a Gastrodon as per Tenjosan’s recommendation, and initially I was going with a more defensive spread but with Modest nature so it could at least do something with its Storm Drain boosts. However, while training it in-game, I accidentally miscounted EVs and he ended up with a lot more Special Attack than he was supposed to have. Considering this was my last Pokemon and the season started in less than a week, I decided I’d just live with this mistake since what was the worst that could happen?<br/>
			<br/>
			Turns out, this set is great. Aside from surviving Precipice Blades from Groudon like it has a secondary ability of Levitate and being maximum indifferent towards Incineroar’s existence, Gastrodon 2HKOs Necrozma Dusk Mane, has a chance to OHKO Groudon outside of the effect of Sun, and even 2HKOs Incineroar. What ended up has a "Oh dammit I didn’t mean to do that" turned into a "Gastrodon you literal god." Slap on Recover so that even in the event that it’s in danger you’re actually fine and Protect because this team was really lacking a lot of Protect users and it was beginning to worry me.
		</p>
		<h2>In Practice</h2>
		<p>
			In practice, I wish I used this team better. After playing both BattleSpot and a Sun Series Premiere Challenge with it, I learned that it actually had a lot of answers to a lot of threats. One thing I did fail to account for, however, was opposing Necrozma Dusk Mane trick room teams; especially a team so popular I fought it verbatim three times at the Premiere Challenge that featured a Weakness Policy Necrozma with Morning Sun. My only solution to that kind of threat was burning their Necrozma with Gastrodon’s Scald before hitting it any other way, and since it was a little too clear that was my only answer it was pretty easy to stop me in my tracks.<br/>
			<br/>
			Aside from this, however, I’m very happy with this as one of my early teams this year. Big thank you to Pokeytrix and Tenjosan for helping me out with a few odds and ends that helped make this team what it is!
